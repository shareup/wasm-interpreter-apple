# WasmInterpreter

`WasmInterpreter` is a small Swift wrapper around [`CWasm3`](https://github.com/shareup/cwasm3), which packages [`wasm3`](https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3) inside of a Swift package while adding a few minor conveniences on top. The overriding goal of `WasmInterpreter` is to provide a clean, Swift-y interface to `wasm3`.

The core class inside of `WasmInterpreter` is, naturally, `WasmInterpreter`. This class is initialized with a stack size _(default: 512 KB)_ and a Wasm module. `WasmInterpreter` takes care of initializing the WebAssembly environment, runtime, and module, and exposes a clean interface for calling Wasm functions, importing native functions into Wasm modules, and extracting data from the runtime's heap. You can find examples for all of these things by looking at the tests.

## Installation

To use `WasmInterpreter` with the Swift Package Manager, add a dependency to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(name: "WasmInterpreter", url: "https://github.com/shareup/wasm-interpreter-apple.git", from: "0.5.1"),
],
```

## Troubleshooting

### Can't build tests with 'ld: Could not open or create -dependency_info file' error

The Address Sanitizer can't be run when linking against SynchronizedDynamicâ€”the dynamic library version of Synchronized. So, either change WasmInterpreter to use Synchronized or disable the Address Sanitizer.
